Nuestra entrada se convierte a una lista de numeros y si salta todas las condiciones imprime la flag

Para esto usamos a una IA y Z3, un solucionador de teoremas (SMT solver) desarrollado por Microsoft Research. Z3 es un motor de razonamiento automatizado que puede resolver sistemas de ecuaciones, restricciones lógicas y problemas de satisfacibilidad.

```python

    # Añadir las restricciones de desigualdad
    # Primera parte: relaciones de orden
